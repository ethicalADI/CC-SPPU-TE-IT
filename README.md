### Cloud Computing Theory

### 1)Google App Engine (GAE):
Description: Google App Engine (GAE) is a cloud platform designed specifically for the development and hosting of web applications.

Functionality: GAE abstracts much of the underlying infrastructure management, enabling developers to focus primarily on writing code, rather than worrying about server management and scalability issues.

 Create a new repository on GitHub.com. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

### 2) Google SDK:
Overview: The Google Software Development Kit (SDK) provides a comprehensive set of tools tailored for creating and deploying applications on Google App Engine (GAE).

Components: One of the key components of the SDK is gcloud, a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the management of cloud resources, including those used in GAE applications.


### 3)GAE Launcher:
Introduction: GAE Launcher is a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) tool designed to facilitate the local management of Google App Engine (GAE) applications.

Features: GAE Launcher simplifies various tasks such as project creation, local execution, and deployment of GAE projects, making it easier for developers to manage their applications during the development process.


### 4) YAML File:
Definition: YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files.

Usage: In the context of Google App Engine (GAE), YAML files serve as a repository for storing application configuration settings and metadata. They ensure readability and ease of maintenance, allowing developers to manage their application configurations effectively.


  
### 5) Python File:
Purpose: The Python file contains the core codebase of the web application hosted on Google App Engine (GAE).

Implementation: Typically written in Python, this file defines the functionality and behavior of the web application. It handles tasks such as responding to HTTP requests, interacting with databases, and shaping the overall behavior of the application.
